<h2>Road Layers</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>VTBuilder supports networks of transportation elements.&nbsp; The topology is represented by <b>nodes</b> (intersections) and
  <b>roads</b> (a centerline path between two nodes).
</p>
  <p>Road data is imported from raw data sources, and saved to a compact Road
  Map Format (RMF). You can load multiple files, merge them, and delete areas
  not of interest.&nbsp; Traffic direction
  and intersection behavior can be modelled and easily edited.</p>
  <p>VTBuilder can import road data from these formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>USGS DLG-O (Digital Line Graph - Optional format)</li>
    <li>ESRI Shape files (SHP)</li>
  </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>In this mode, you may select roads in the road map by
            left clicking on them (click again to deselect.)&nbsp; Double
            clicking will bring up that roads properties in a dialog box.&nbsp; You may also modify multiple roads at once by selecting multiple
            roads and then right clicking anywhere on the road map.</li>
          <li>Road properties include:
            <ul type="disc">

          <li>In this mode, you may select nodes in the road map by
            left clicking on them (click again to deselect.)&nbsp; Double
            clicking will bring up that nodes properties in a dialog box.&nbsp;

          <li>Node properties include:
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Intersection Type (Signal lights, Stop sign, or
                uncontrolled/none.)</li>
              <li>Properties for each of the road at the intersection
                point.&nbsp; Each road is associated with a number as seen on
                the diagram on the right side of the dialog box.
                <ul type="circle">
                  <li>A red outline of an octagon denotes a stop sign for the
                    road at the given node.</li>
                  <li>A solid circle denotes a signal sign for the road at the
                    given node.&nbsp; Signal lights of like color (red or green)
                    indicate linked signal lights (determined
                    automatically.)&nbsp; A black circle indicates that the
                    signal light hasn't been set up properly.&nbsp; Simply force
                    the intersection type to signal lights to fix the problem.</li>
                  <li>If the road is uncontrolled, there will not be any symbol.</li>

      <li><a name="Select Whole">Select Whole</a> Roads
        <ul>
          <li>Click on a road, and VTBuilder will attempt to select all adjacent
            roads that constitute a single conceptual &quot;road&quot;.&nbsp;
            For example, you can use this to select an entire highway at once.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Set Road Direction
        <ul>
          <li>Adjust traffic direction on roads by left clicking on the road.
            <ul>
              <li><font color="#008000"><b>&lt;&gt;</b> </font>- two-way traffic</li>

      </li>
      <li>Edit Road Points
        <ul>
          <li>In this mode, you can use the mouse to drag individual points of
            the roads.&nbsp; Click on any road to select the points in that
            road, then click and drag those points to move them.&nbsp; Note that
            intersections are not currently moved correctly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Show Nodes
        <ul>
          <li>Toggles the display of nodes (intersections).&nbsp; Turning this
            off is useful to make roads faster to display and edit.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select Highway Number
        <ul>
          <li>Simply enter the number of the highway you want selected.</li>

      </li>
      <li><a name="Clean">Clean</a> RoadMap
        <ul>
          <li>This powerful feature will perform a number of steps to fix errors
            in current road layer.&nbsp; This is very important because raw
            sources of road data such as USGS DLG files often contain dangerous anomalies.&nbsp;
            The following actions are performed:
            <ul>
              <li>Merge Redundant Nodes
        <ul>
          <li>Merges nodes that are extremely close to each other.&nbsp; This function joins
            roads that were cut off on adjacent source files.&nbsp; However, the
            roads are still separate.</li>
        </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Remove Degenerate Roads
        <ul>
          <li>Removes small roads that don't go anywhere (i.e. start and end at same
            point and have less than 3 points.)</li>
        </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Remove Unnecessary Nodes
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminates nodes and merges the 2 roads into one road if the 2 roads
            have the same properties.</li>
        </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Clean Road Points
        <ul>
          <li>Ensures that roads end on nodes and eliminates any repeating
            points.</li>
        </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Delete Dangling Roads
        <ul>
          <li>Delete roads that either:
            <ul type="circle">
              <li type="disc">have the same start and end nodes and have less
                than 4 points</li>
              <li type="disc">have less than 2 points, regardless of start or
                end nodes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Remove Unused Nodes
        <ul>
          <li>Deletes nodes with no roads.</li>
        </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Fix Overlapped Roads
        <ul>
          <li>Fix when two different roads meet at the same node along the same path</li>
        </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Fix Extraneous Parallels
        <ul>
          <li>Delete roads that are really close to other roads and lead nowhere.</li>
        </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Split Looping Roads
        <ul>
          <li>Splits a road that has the same start and end point.&nbsp; Road
            will be split at the middle point and a new uncontrolled node will
            be created between the 2 new roads.</li>
        </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

<h4><a name="Use of RMF Files">Use of RMF Files</a>

  <p>In order to use the RMF files you have generated, copy them to the VTP
  Enviro data directory <b>Enviro/Data/RoadData.</b>&nbsp; The next time
  you run Enviro, they will appear on the &quot;Roads Filename&quot;
  drop-down control in the Create Terrain dialog.</p>

<p>Currently Unimplemented:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Merge 2 nodes.
        <ul>
          <li>Merges the 2 selected nodes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Path Finder
        <ul>
          <li>Tool to create a path for a vehicle to follow in the Enviro Program.</li>
          <li>There are 3 steps:
            <ul>
              <li>Select the start node.</li>
              <li>Select roads to create the path.&nbsp; This can
                be done in 2 ways.&nbsp; First, you can choose another node and
                let VTBuilder find the shortest path from the start point to the
                selected point ( <img border="0" src="images/README14.gif" align="middle" width="34" height="30">
                on the toolbar - default setting.)&nbsp; Second, you may also
                select individual roads to create the path - you must choose
                connected roads ( <img border="0" src="images/README15.gif" align="middle" width="34" height="30">
                on the toolbar.)</li>
              <li>Save the path by clicking on <img border="0" src="images/README16.gif" align="middle" width="34" height="30">
                in the toolbar.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
