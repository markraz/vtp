<h2>Area Tool</h2>
This tool lets you indicate a rectangular area of
interest.&nbsp; It's useful for indicating <i>where</i> you want to operate on 
other layers, such as elevation, imagery, and vegetation.
<h3>Menus:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Area Tool</b><ul>
      <li>Set to Extents<ul>
          <li>Resizes the area tool to surround all of the currently loaded 
          layers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Set to Layer Extents<ul>
          <li>Resizes the area tool to surround the currently selected layer.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Numeric Values
        <ul>
          <li>Allows you to examine and manually enter the range of the  area 
          tool.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Merge &amp; Resample Elevation
        <ul>
          <li>Displays the <b>Merge and Resample Elevation</b> dialog (see 
          below)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Merge &amp; Resample Imagery<ul>
      <li>Displays the <b>Merge and Resample Imagery</b> dialog (see 
          below)</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Generate  Vegetation
        <ul>
          <li>See <a href="vegetation.html">Vegetation</a> for an description of
            how to use this command.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Request Layer from WFS</li>
      <li>Request Layer from WMS<ul>
      <li>These are experimental commands.&nbsp; If you know how to use a WFS or 
      WMS, give them a try!</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Toolbar:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Area Tool (<img border="0" src="images/tb_area.png" align="bottom" width="39" height="37">) 
  can be used to set the desired area directly with the mouse.&nbsp; Click on 
  any edge of the area tool to move that edge, or click inside to move the whole 
  area without resizing.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Merge and Resample Elevation Dialog</b></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can choose where the output will go: To a new layer (in memory), To a 
  file, or To a tileset (folder of tiles).</p>
  <p>This dialog displays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The size of the <b>Save Area</b>, in either meters or degrees</li>
    <li>An estimated <b>Sample factor</b>, which is a guess based on looking at
      the X spacing of the first elevation layer.</li>
    <li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which shows you the size of a grid
      that would result from sampling the area at the indicated sample
      factor.&nbsp; Assuming that your input layers are of the same density
      (spacing), this indicates the approximate grid size of the indicated area.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Output to a new layer or to a file:</h4>
  <blockquote>
  <p>You can change the sample factor to see the projected size change.&nbsp;
  Once you have a good idea of what output size you want, specify it in the
  &quot;<b>X size</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Y size</b>&quot; fields.</p>
  <p>Note that there is a helpful &quot;<b>Powers of 2 + 1</b>&quot; constraint
  you can use to limit the output to sizes which are supported by Terrain LOD,
  which is highly desirable at visualization runtime.</p>
  <p>For effective visualization it is recommended that you pick a output size
  that is at least as large as your input data, but within the limits of your
  computer's RAM.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>Output to a folder of tiles (Tileset):</h4>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This option has no limit on the size of the data.&nbsp; Press <i>Tile 
  Options</i> for the <b>Tiling Options</b> dialog.&nbsp; Give the output a 
  filename, and set the number of rows and columns of the tile grid along with 
  the tile size (LOD0 Size) which gives the highest resolution of each tile.&nbsp; 
  The <b>Information</b> display helps you see whether your tiling is a good 
  approximation of the input data your are resampling.&nbsp; For smoother 
  visualization, is it good to keep the tile grid size large and the LOD0 Size 
  small (512 or less) so that there are shorter pauses as each tile is paged.&nbsp; 
  Alternately, if smoothness isn't a concern, you can decrease the tile grid 
  size, and increase the LOD0 Size, which will result in a drastically smaller 
  number of files on your disk.</p>
  <p>See <a href="../Enviro/tilesets.html">Enviro: Tilesets</a> for a 
  description of how tilesets are handled at runtime.&nbsp; If you are using a 
  tileset for your elevation, you must have a tileset of the same grid size for 
  the imagery.</p>
