<h2>Structure Layers</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Built Structure data includes buildings, fences, and other artificial
  structures not described by other layer types.&nbsp; Structure files can be loaded and saved from
  VTST files.</p>
  <p>You can also import Structure data from Shapefiles.&nbsp; The Shapefile
  should contains arc (polygon) data, which will be interpreted as building footprints.</p>
  <p> If you have another source of building location/footprint data
  that you would like to import, <a href="mailto:feedback@vterrain.org">please
  let us know</a>.</p>
