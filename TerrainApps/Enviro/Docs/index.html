<p><b>Enviro</b> is the VTP runtime environment program.&nbsp; It provides an interactive,
realtime 3D navigation of your virtual terrain.&nbsp; There are two primary view
modes: <b>Earth</b> and <b>Terrain</b>.&nbsp; At startup, you chose which view
you want to start with, and you can switch at any time.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Earth View</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>At startup, select &quot;Earth View&quot; and press OK.&nbsp; You are now
  viewing the planet from space.</p>

  <p><b>How to Navigate:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>To spin the viewpoint around the earth, hold down the <b>middle </b>mouse
      button.</li>
    <li>To zoom in and out, use the <b>shift key</b> and the <b>middle </b>mouse
      button to drag up and down.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each known terrain area will be shown as a small red rectangle on the
  earth.&nbsp; To switch to a terrain, just click within its rectangle with the <b>left</b>  mouse
  button.</p>
  <p><b>Commands:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Earth - <b>Show Time of Day</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>shows the earth illuminated by
      sunlight based on real, current time according to your computer's clock</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Earth - <b>Add Point Data</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>allows you to display a set of point data
      (from a Shapefile) on the Earth as small yellow points.</li>
        <li>Try the file <b>Data/PointData/vtp-users.shp</b> to see the
          locations of the first 2260 VTP recipients.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Terrain View</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> At startup, to launch with Terrain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use &quot;Select&quot; to choose from the known terrain.</li>
  <li>Use &quot;Edit Properties&quot; to view or edit the properties of the currently
    chosen terrain (the <b><a href="terrain_creation.html">Terrain Creation Parameters</a></b> 
    dialog)</li>
</ul>
<p>Press &quot;OK&quot;.&nbsp; The terrain will now load, which may take up to a
minute.&nbsp; Messages in the status bar will inform you of the loading
progress.</p>

<h4> How to Navigate:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Here's a handy guide for <a href="Navigation/index.html">using
    the mouse to navigate</a> in Terrain View.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making Your Own Terrain</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Put your data in the following directories:
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#C2C7D6">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%"><b>Data</b></td>
          <td width="50%"><b>Location</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">elevation data (BT and PRJ files)</td>
          <td width="50%"><code>Data/Elevation</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">geospecific images (BMP or JPG files)</td>
          <td width="50%"><code>Data/GeoSpecific</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">road data (RMF files)</td>
          <td width="50%"><code>Data/RoadData</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">built structure data (VTST files)</td>
          <td width="50%"><code>Data/BuildingData</code></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
    <li>Don't forget that in order to use the continuous LOD rendering,
      elevation files must be square-power-of-2-plus-1 in size.&nbsp; For
      example:
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#C2C7D6">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">513 x 513</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">1025 x 1025</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">2049 x 2049</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">4097 x 4097</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">8193 x 8193</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
    <li>In the Startup Dialog, use the &quot;Generic Terrain&quot; setting,
      press &quot;Edit Properties&quot;, and select your data in
      the Parameters dialog</li>
    <li>If you want to make your terrain show up as a new terrain in the Enviro 
    startup dialog, then you can create your own .ini files in the Terrain 
    folder on the data path.&nbsp; One easy way to do this is to copy one of the 
    existing .ini files (for example, Generic.ini) and edit it, either as a text 
    file or with Enviro, to contain the settings you want.&nbsp; The first line 
    in the file (&quot;Name&quot;) is the name that will appear in Enviro.</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Using Your Own Imagery (Textures)</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Your image needs to match your elevation in both projection and extents.&nbsp; 
    One way to do this is to use VTBuilder to re-project and crop your 
    elevation, as needed, to match your image.</li>
    <li>Your imagery should be converted to either the BMP or JPG format.</li>
    <li>Learn how large a texture your computer can display.&nbsp; From
      the Enviro Start dialog, press &quot;OpenGL Info...&quot; and look at the
      number for &quot;Maximum Texture Dimension&quot;</li>
    <li>If your terrain texture map is not larger than the maximum texture, you
      can use the &quot;Single texture&quot; option, otherwise you will need to
      use &quot;4x4 Tiled texture&quot;.</li>
    <li>Give your texture a filename ending in it's size, e.g.
      &quot;<code>newyork_1024.bmp</code>&quot;</li>
    <li>Put your texture in in the directory<code>  Data/GeoSpecific</code></li>
    <li>For a Single texture:
      <ul>
        <li>Your texture size must be a square power of 2, up to the limit of your computer
          (e.g. 512, 1024)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For a 4x4 Tiles texture:
      <ul>
        <li>You provide a single large square image file, and Enviro will break
          it up for you, at runtime, into a set of 16 tiles (4x4)</li>
        <li>The size of each tile must be a power of 2, up to the limit of your computer
          (e.g. 512, 1024)</li>
        <li>Due to pixel overlap to avoid texture seams, the dimensions may seem
          somewhat unusual - e.g. 2045 for a 4x4 at 512, 4093 for a 4x4 at 1024</li>
        <li>The filename is made up of two parts: the prefix (e.g. &quot;hawaii_&quot;)
          and the image size (e.g. &quot;4093&quot;). The dialog lets you
          specify the prefix, and it computes and appends the image size, based
          on the tile size you specify</li>
        <li>So, when you're preparing your image files, simply name them ending
          in a number that is their size in pixels (e.g.
          &quot;hawaii_4093.bmp&quot;)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Data in a Different Location</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to put your Data directory in another location, edit
    your<code> </code><code>Enviro.ini</code><code> </code>file and change the
    first line to contain the path to the data.&nbsp; The path can be relative
    or absolute, and should leave on a trailing slash.&nbsp; For example, the
    default path is:<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataPath ../Data/</code><br>
    You could change it to paths such as these, depending on your platform:<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataPath ../../Data/<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataPath C:\MyData\<br>
    </code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataPath /</code><code>home/me/mydata/<br>
    </code></li>
  <li>If you have data in different places, you can simply put more than one
    &quot;<code>DataPath</code>&quot; line into the <code>Enviro.ini</code>
    file, and all the data on all the paths will be available to Enviro.</li>
</ul>
  <h4>Notes for Developers</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>If you want to fully customize the terrain, such as adding your own
      custom objects and behaviors to the scene
      <ol>
        <li>create a sub-class of <code>vtTerrain</code>, using one of the
          existing subclasses (like <code>TransitTerrain</code>) as an example</li>
        <li>in <code>Enviro.cpp,</code> add a line to the function <code>LoadTerrainDescriptions</code><code>()</code>,
          so that your .ini file will be constructed with your terrain class</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
