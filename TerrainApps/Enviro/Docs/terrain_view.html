<h2>Terrain View</h2>

<blockquote>

<p> From the Startup Dialog, to launch with Terrain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the drop-down control to choose from the known terrains.</li>
  <li>Use &quot;Edit Properties&quot; to view or edit the properties of the currently
    chosen terrain (the <b><a href="terrain_creation.html">Terrain  Parameters</a></b> 
    dialog)</li>
</ul>
<p>Press &quot;OK&quot;.&nbsp; The terrain will now load, which may take up to a
minute.&nbsp; Messages in the status bar will inform you of the loading
progress.</p>

<h4> How to Navigate:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Here's a handy guide for <a href="Navigation/index.html">using
    the mouse to navigate</a> in Terrain View.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Menu Commands for Terrain View</h3>

  <h4>File Menu</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Layers</b> - Shows the Layers dialog.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Tools Menu</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Select</b> - This mode lets use use the mouse point to move the 3D 
  cursor on the terrain, selecting objects and moving them by dragging.&nbsp; 
  You can also right-click for a pop-up menu of actions for the selected 
  objects.&nbsp; See <a href="culture.html">Working with Culture Objects</a> for 
  more information.</li>
  <li><b>Fences</b> - Opens the Linear Structures dialog for creating features 
  like fences, walls and hedges.&nbsp; Click to add points on the terrain, 
  right-click to close the feature.</li>
  <li><b>Buildings</b> - Click on the terrain to create buildings.&nbsp; Each 
  click defines a corner of the building footprints, right-click finishes 
  definition.</li>
  <li><b>Routes</b> - Opens the Routes dialog for creating utility routes, 
  specifically electrical distribution lines.</li>
  <li><b>Plants</b> - Opens the Plants dialog for creating plants by clicking on 
  the terrain.&nbsp; See <a href="culture.html">Working with Culture Objects</a> 
  for more information.</li>
  <li><b>Points</b> - Use the mouse to click on the terrain to create labeled 
  points.&nbsp; The first time you select this mode, it will ask you for the 
  style you want (Color, Size, etc.).&nbsp; The points are generated in a new 
  Abstract Layer, which you can view and save from the Layers Dialog.</li>
  <li><b>Instances</b> - Opens the Instances dialog for creating 3D model 
  instances by clicking on the terrain.</li>
  <li><b>Vehicles</b> - Opens the Vehicles dialog for creating vehicle models by clicking on the terrain.&nbsp; 
  Vehicles can be selected, moved and rotated just like instances.</li>
  <li><b>Navigate</b> - Use the mouse to fly over the terrain.&nbsp; See <a href="Navigation/index.html">using
    the mouse to navigate</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Measure Distances</b> - Opens the Distance dialog.&nbsp; Drag a line on 
  the terrain to get information about the distance measured several ways.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Navigate Menu</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Fly Slower</b> - Decrease flight speed</li>
  <li><b>Fly Faster</b> - Increase flight speed</li>
  <li><b>Maintain height above ground</b> (toggle) - Keeps the camera at a fixed 
  height above the terrain.</li>
  <li><b>Navigation Style</b> - Choose from several styles of navigation to find 
  one you like.&nbsp; There is also a keyboard shortcut 'D' to toggle the 
  Grab-Pivot navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Terrain Menu</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>LOD Terrain Surface </b>(toggle) - Show the terrain surface.</li>
  <li><b>Cull every frame</b> (toggle) - Continuously calculates the level of 
  detail needed as the camera moves.&nbsp; You can turn this off to see how the 
  CLOD algorithm is working.</li>
  <li><b>Cull once</b> - When Cull Every Frame is turned off, this tells the 
  CLOD to calculate (cull).</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 9"><b>Show Sky</b> (toggle) - The sky (Skydome) is a 
  hemisphere which surround the camera, showing either a static texture, or 
  correct lighting for the time of day (sun, moon, stars, sunrise, sunset).</li>
  <li><b>Show Horizon</b> (toggle) - The horizon is the flat geometry between 
  the edge of the terrain and the far clipping plane.</li>
  <li><b>Show Ocean</b> (toggle) - The ocean plane is an additional flat 
  geometry which intersects the entire terrain, with a watery translucent 
  texture.</li>
  <li><b>Show Plants</b> (toggle) - You can turn all plants (the Vegetation 
  Layer) on and off.</li>
  <li><b>Show Structures</b> (toggle).</li>
  <li><b>Show Roads</b> (toggle).</li>
  <li><b>Show Fog</b> (toggle).</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 9"><b>Increase Detail</b> - Increases the detail 
  (triangles or vertices used) of the CLOD terrain surface by 1000.&nbsp; If 
  your terrain is over-simplified, you should increase detail until it looks 
  good.</li>
  <li><b>Decrease Detail</b> - Decreases the detail (triangles or vertices used) 
  of the CLOD terrain surface by 1000.</li>
  <li><b>Level of Detail Info</b> - Shows the Terrain LOD Info dialog with 
  technical information about the CLOD algorithm and (if you are using Tilesets) 
  the texture paging.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 9"><b>Toggle Artificial Foundations</b> - For the 
  current structure layer, each building which lies on a slope has a cement 
  &quot;foundation&quot; level added to elevate it such that no point of the base 
  footprint lies beneath ground level.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;<b>Recalculate Shading</b> - If your terrain has shading that was 
  computed at the time the terrain was constructed, then that shading is 
  recalculated.&nbsp; The current time of day is used.&nbsp; This is useful for 
  seeing what a terrain looks like at different times of day.</li>
  <li><b>Change Texture</b> - Opens the Change Texture dialog to let you change 
  the texture on the terrain.</li>
  <li><b>Distribute Vehicles</b> - Puts a number of test vehicles around your 
  road network, where they will will traverse randomly.&nbsp; This is not a real 
  simulation, just a simple test.</li>
</ul>
