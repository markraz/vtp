<h3>Structure Layers</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Built Structure data includes buildings, fences, and other artificial
  structures not described by other layer types.&nbsp; The native file format 
  for Structure files is <a href="http://vterrain.org/Implementation/VTST.html">VTST files</a>.</p>
  <p>You can also import Structure data from Shapefiles.&nbsp; The Shapefile
  should contains arc (polygon) data, which will be interpreted as building footprints.</p>
  <p> If you have another source of building location/footprint data
  that you would like to import, <a href="mailto:feedback@vterrain.org">please
  let us know</a>.</p>

<h3>Structures Menu</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Select Features
            <ul>
              <li>In this mode, you can select structures (by clicking or
                dragging the left mouse button) and edit their properties (by
                click the right mouse button).&nbsp; Properties you can edit
                include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Color</li>
                  <li>Number of Stories</li>
                  <li>Roof Style</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Edit Buildings
            <ul>
              <li>In this mode, you can edit the shape and location of
                buildings:
                <ul>
                  <li>Grab the center of a building to move it or grab a corner
                    to resize it</li>
                  <li>Hold down Shift and grab the corner of a building to
                    evenly scale it </li>
                  <li>Hold down Ctrl and grab the corner of a building to rotate
                    it </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

<h3>Importing Structures from Shapefiles</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is the easiest way to populate your terrain with a lot of structures 
  if you already have GIS data for their locations.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li>Use the &quot;Layer: Import Data&quot; command and select &quot;Structures&quot; as the layer 
  type.</li>
  <li>Select your Shapefile (*.shp)<br>
  Shapefiles with polygon data can be turned into building footprints.<br>
  Shapefiles with arc data can be turned into fence lines.<br>
  Shapefiles with point data can be either building centers, or instance 
  locations.</li>
  <li>Indicate how to interpret the Shapefile (one of the above 3 meanings)</li>
  <li>Optionally, you can restrict the import to only use features that lie 
  within your Area tool.&nbsp; This is useful if you have a massive GIS data 
  source and only care about a specific area.</li>
  <li>If you are importing building footprints, you have the option of reversing 
  the order of their points (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  VTP convention is counter-clockwise.&nbsp; If you find that your buildings 
  look inside-out in 3D, or your know that your data source defines then 
  clockwise, then say Yes.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>The data will then import, so you can review it and save to VTST.</p>
  <p><b>Attributes: </b>&nbsp;Building footprints will be created with the 
  default attributes of 1 story, flat red roof.&nbsp; If there is a SHP field 
  called &quot;stories&quot;, it will be used for the number of stories.&nbsp; There are 
  plans to extend this functionality soon to allow any of the fields to be 
  mapped onto any attribute.</p>
  <p>Remember that when you are ready to use VTST data with Enviro, you should 
  put it in the &quot;BuildingData&quot; folder on your Data path.</p>
