<h3>Export Area Tool</h3>
The export area is a tool you can use to indicate a rectangular area of
interest.&nbsp; You can then use this area to indicate where you want to
generate and export elevation or vegetation.
<p>Menus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Export Area</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Set to Extents
        <ul>
          <li>Moves the black lines to surround all of the currently loaded
            terrains.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Numeric Values
        <ul>
          <li>Allows you to examine and manually enter the range of the export
            area.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Merge &amp; Export Elevation
        <ul>
          <li>Displays the <b>Merge and Resample</b> dialog (see below) and then
            asks for a filename to export elevation to.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Generate &amp; Export Vegetation
        <ul>
          <li>see <a href="vegetation.html">Vegetation</a> for an description of
            how to use this command</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Merge and Resample Dialog</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This dialog displays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The size of the <b>Save Area</b>, in either meters or degrees</li>
    <li>An estimated <b>Sample factor</b>, which is a guess based on looking at
      the X spacing of the first elevation layer.</li>
    <li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which is the size of a grid
      that would result from sampling the area at the indicated sample
      factor.&nbsp; Assuming that your input layers are of the same density
      (spacing), this indicates the approximate grid size of the indicated area.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can change the sample factor to see the projected size change.&nbsp;
  Once you have a good idea of what output size you want, specify it in the
  &quot;<b>X size</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Y size</b>&quot; fields.</p>
  <p>Note that there is a helpful &quot;<b>Powers of 2 + 1</b>&quot; constraint
  you can use to limit the output to sizes which are supported by Terrain LOD,
  which is highly desirable at visualization runtime.</p>
  <p>For effective visualization, it is recommended that you pick a output size
  that is at least as large as your input data, but within the limits of your
  computer's RAM. </p>
