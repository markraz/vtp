<h2>Area Tool</h2>
This tool lets you indicate a rectangular area of
interest.&nbsp; It's useful for indicating <i>where</i> you want to operate on 
other layers, such as elevation, imagery, and vegetation.
<h3>Menus:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Area Tool</b><ul>
      <li>Set to Extents<ul>
          <li>Resized the area tool to surround all of the currently loaded 
          layers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Numeric Values
        <ul>
          <li>Allows you to examine and manually enter the range of the  area 
          tool.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Merge &amp; Resample Elevation
        <ul>
          <li>Displays the <b>Merge and Resample Elevation</b> dialog (see 
          below)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Extract and Export Image<ul>
      <li>Allows you to merge, resample and export your Image layers, just like 
      Elevation layers.</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Generate  Vegetation
        <ul>
          <li>See <a href="vegetation.html">Vegetation</a> for an description of
            how to use this command.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Request Layer from WFS</li>
      <li>Request Layer from WMS<ul>
      <li>These are experimental commands.&nbsp; If you know how to use a WFS or 
      WMS, give them a try!</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Toolbar:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Area Tool (<img border="0" src="images/tb_area.png" align="top" width="39" height="37">) 
  can be used to set the desired area directly with the mouse.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Merge and Resample Elevation Dialog</b></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This dialog displays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The size of the <b>Save Area</b>, in either meters or degrees</li>
    <li>An estimated <b>Sample factor</b>, which is a guess based on looking at
      the X spacing of the first elevation layer.</li>
    <li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which shows you the size of a grid
      that would result from sampling the area at the indicated sample
      factor.&nbsp; Assuming that your input layers are of the same density
      (spacing), this indicates the approximate grid size of the indicated area.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can change the sample factor to see the projected size change.&nbsp;
  Once you have a good idea of what output size you want, specify it in the
  &quot;<b>X size</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Y size</b>&quot; fields.</p>
  <p>Note that there is a helpful &quot;<b>Powers of 2 + 1</b>&quot; constraint
  you can use to limit the output to sizes which are supported by Terrain LOD,
  which is highly desirable at visualization runtime.</p>
  <p>For effective visualization, it is recommended that you pick a output size
  that is at least as large as your input data, but within the limits of your
  computer's RAM. </p>
