<h2>Vegetation Layers</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>To learn how the VTP software represents vegetation, first read the web
  page <a href="http://vterrain.org/Implementation/Veg/">VTP Implementation
  Vegetation</a>.&nbsp; The following assumes that you are familiar with the
  terminology.</p>
  <p>VTBuilder can import vegetation data from these formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>USGS LULC (Land Use / Land Cover, usual file extension is <b>.gir</b>)</li>
    <li>ESRI Shape files (<b>.shp</b>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are several type of Vegetation Data.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Density</b> - polygonal areas which contain information (0 to 1)
      about how dense the vegetation is.</li>
    <li><b>Biotype</b> - polygonal areas which describe which biotype is found
      in that area.</li>
    <li><b>Explicit</b> - a set of actual plant instances.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Currently you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>import <b>Density</b> from LULC and Shapefiles.</li>
    <li>import <b>Biotype</b> from Shapefiles</li>
    <li>export <b>Explicit</b> instances to a VF file, which can be read by VTP
      Enviro</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use these steps to generate a vegetation distribution.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Load your Plant List.&nbsp; An example file is is <code>VTP/Enviro/Data/PlantData/plants.txt</code></li>
    <li>Load your Bioregion (list of Biotypes).&nbsp; An example file is in <code>VTP/Enviro/Data/PlantData/bioregion.txt</code></li>
    <li>Import at least one layer with <b>Density</b></li>
    <li>Import at least one layer with <b>Biotype</b></li>
    <li>Use the Export Area tool to indicate the area in which to distribute the
      vegetation</li>
    <li>Give the command &quot;Export Area - Generate and Export
      Vegetation&quot;&nbsp; A dialog will ask for :
      <ul>
        <li>Grid Spacing of Sampling, in meters.&nbsp; The distribution will
          occur on a regular grid.&nbsp; At each point, it will test to see what
          kind of plant belongs at that location, given all known inputs.&nbsp;
          Then, if a plant is generated, a small random offset is applied to
          avoid the &quot;regular&quot; look of an evenly distribution.</li>
        <li>Artificial Scarcity.&nbsp; Most interactive simulation can't handle
          the full density of real-world vegetation.&nbsp; You can set this to a
          value less than 1 to produce an artificially scarce
          distribution.&nbsp; For example, 0.001 will produce 1/1000 of the
          normal density of vegetation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The resulting VF file can be used by Enviro.</li>
  </ol>
